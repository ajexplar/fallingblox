A falling block game made in SFML 2.0 and C++11.

Press the arrow keys to control the shape as it descends, and press 'R' to
rotate it. Pressing 'P' will pause the game.

When the game ends, your score will be recorded in a text file loaded by the
game (so it is dependent on the honor system!). You can then Quit or Restart.

# Notice
I haven't included the media that plays as SFX or BG, and I left out the font
and image files either. I may upload them at a later date.

# TODO
Add a mute option
Update to SFML 2.3 at least
