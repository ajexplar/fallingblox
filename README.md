A falling block game made in SFML 2.0 and C++11.

# Controls
- Press the arrow keys to control the shape as it descends toward the bottom of the screen
- Press 'R' to rotate the shape before it finishes moving
- Press 'P' to pause the game.

When the game ends, your score will be recorded in a text file loaded by the
game (so it is dependent on the honor system!). You can then Quit or Restart.

# Notice
I haven't included the media that plays as SFX or BG, and I left out the font
and image files to save some space. I may upload them at a later date.

# TODO
* Add a mute option
* Update to SFML 2.3 at least
